> We all strive to create a great experience for our users, but too often our modern design and development practices leave behind users that don’t have the devices, network speed, or physical abilities that our sites demand. By making your sites accessible, fast, progressively enhanced, and responsive, you can make sure *all* your users get the great experience they deserve. In this talk, I will describe how Universal Web Design principles can be easily applied to new or existing sites, how these principles will improve your users’ experience, and how Universal Web Design will save you time and money.
